# DiscordInviteGenerator
A free and open-source discord invite generator and checker that utilizes proxies, threading, and the requests module.

## Usage

Depending on your python installation your commands may vary. 
Below are the commands you should run before execution.
The script below auto-scrapes for proxies, then uses them to mass check discord invites. The chances of getting a valid invite is semi-small, but very possible. I recommend leaving this open and checking back on it. 
Note: The webhook is for sending valid server invites.

The script was tested in python 3.8.6, on windows 10.

```
git clone https://github.com/LocalsGitHub/DiscordInviteGenerator.git
cd DiscordInviteGenerator
pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
```
